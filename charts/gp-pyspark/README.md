gp-pyspark
==============
This is a standalone process for data-aggregation. The application code is [here](https://github.com/Git-Prime/gp-pyspark).

### Configuration
For configuration options for each job, see [this documentation](https://github.com/bambash/helm-cronjobs#configuration). You can specify as many jobs as you want in the jobs array and helm-operator will create each one as an individual cronjob with whatever values you specify for it.
